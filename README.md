## Problem Statement :
Business environment of today is more competitive than it used to be. This leads to increased pressure in the workplace. Therefore, it is reasonable to expect that unachievable business goals and an elevated risk of unemployment can raise people's stress levels.

Having such information in advance can improve our decision making how by reorganizing the work process in a way that will allow us to avoid a lack of productivity and increase the quality of work generated in our firm.

The absence from work during normal working hours resulting in temporary incapacity to execute regular working activity OK.

### Purpose: 
The purpose of the business exercise will be to explore whether a person presenting certain characteristics is expected to be away from work at some point in time or not. In other words, we want to know for how many working hours an employee could be away from work based on information such as how far they live from their workplace how many children and pets they have. Do they have higher education and so on.
